Rene bugreport in CTF:

we found a bug in CTF when 3 players, if both flags are captured if the 3rd player (blue) is killed, then a new flag spawns on the
opposite team (red) allowing them to capture (while the original red flag is still held by the living blue player)


=== Minion swarm
each team has a home base. 
Team minions spawn on the side and go towards opposing base. 
If minion touches enemy base it explodes
